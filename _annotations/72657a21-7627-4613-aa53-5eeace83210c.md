<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Garamond, serif;">The size of the Jubilee Singers has varied over the years. The initial group had nine members. When they became successful and went abroad, the troupe grew to eleven members. Under the direction of Mrs. James A. Meyers from 1928 to 1947, the group varied in size, sometimes with only four to six people. In 2021, the group has twelve members.</span></p>
