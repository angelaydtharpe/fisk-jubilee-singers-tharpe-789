<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Garamond, serif;">George White was a White man in his twenties when he founded the Fisk Jubilee Singers in 1871. Initially a music teacher at Fisk, with time, White became the university&rsquo;s treasurer. When Fisk went into debt, White gathered together his best students to perform in order to fundraise for the school. Initially, the musical group traveled across Tennessee, and not only sang, but did recitations, gymnastics and drama performances. Eventually, they traveled North, and when the group, who mainly sang popular songs, included a few spirituals in their performance, the White crowd responded with enthusiasm. This made the Black performers uncomfortable, as the slave songs had been largely shielded from White consumption until then, but George White encouraged them to teach him &ldquo;the music their parents and grandparents had sung as slaves&rdquo;, and when they did, they came to represent the Black religious experience for their White audiences &nbsp;(&ldquo;George White&rdquo;).</span></p>
